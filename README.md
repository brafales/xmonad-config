xmonad configuration
====================
This is the xmonad configuration that I use at work. It uses dzen2 and conky for the status bars.

[xmonad](http://xmonad.org/) is a tiling window manager written in Haskell.

final configuration feel free to visit the [explaining post at ThinkInGeek](http://thinkingeek.com/2011/11/21/simple-guide-configure-xmonad-dzen2-conky/)
